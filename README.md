“The outline builder” 

The goal of this exercise is to build the smallest possible polygon 
(smallest area) that contains all the lines in an area.

Notes and input about the problem:
- The set of lines that come as the input parameter can be completely random. No kind of structure (parallel or perpendicular) can be assumed

- If we consider that where there are lines, there is a plot of "something". And we want an outline of where there is “something”.

- The distance between the lines should be considered when computing an outline, because it would most likely mean that the lines are related to each other, maybe depending on the overall average distance between the lines

- The angle of the lines has an impact on the line relationship. As such we can consider that there are "groups" of lines, where each group represents an "area" with something. And it is these areas that we want to get a final outline from
